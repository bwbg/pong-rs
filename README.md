# Pong

Implementation of the ubiquitous Pong arcade game as part of the 100 days of
code challenge [`#100DaysOfCode`][HDOC].

## Development Log

### Day 1

This is the first day of the [`#100DaysOfCode`][HDOC] challenge. Today I setup the project's repository and made an initial commit with some basic additions to the configuration file.

The first choice I had to make was what library to use to display the game and handle input. I decided against the [famous bevy](BEVY) and favoured [SDL2](SDL2) because I already met SDL with PyGame.
